# thm-koth

Hi my name is 0x776F6C66 (wolf). I am a red teamer and cybersec enthusiast.

This is a repo that'll hold all tricks and tips (scripts and other tools that i use while playing koth.)
The tools and scripts are mainly for:

* maintaining persistence
* wiping tracks 
* unhiding/revealing opponents' tricks.
* priviledge escalation

The tools .e.t.c can be used for real life tasks such as penetration testing and red teaming but I think the knowledge is enough to start writing your own tools. Don't be a script kiddie !!!

Use the information here to learn and become an elite hacker.
If you wish to contribute to the repo, don't hesitate to push a pull request. :)

The directories are as follows:
* Scripts - contains scripts for normal use such as spamming and killing enemy pty's and tty's
* Persistence - cotains scripts and services that can be used to automate setting persistence
